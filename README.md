# TeamFormationOptimizer
A scalable Python algorithm designed to form diverse and balanced student teams for large datasets.

Instead of random groupings, this project ensures every team benefits from a strategic blend of key diversity factors like gender, CGPA, and school affiliation.
The algorithm is optimised for fairness, speed, and scalability, and is built to handle hundreds of entries without compromising on balance.

In real-world academic and organisational settings, forming fair, diverse teams is rarely random; it is more strategic.
This project addresses that need by automating intelligent team formation with multiple fairness constraints.

This project was developed as part of my Python module (Intro to Computational Thinking) at NTU.
